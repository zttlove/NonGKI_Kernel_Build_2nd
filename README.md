### Introduction

The initial goal of this project was to provide a relatively stable channel for compiling and updating **KernelSU** and **SuSFS** for a wider range of **Non-GKI** kernels.  
It also aims to provide an easier compilation process using **GitHub Actions**, which not only makes it easier for us to maintain but also allows you to use our project to compile your own kernels.

  - [x] Submodules are easy to understand and learn from.
- [x] **Ease of Use**
  - [x] If you don't need SuSFS, you can compile directly after modifying only a few variables.
  - [x] Easier to fill out and call patches after locally generating SuSFS patch files.
  - [x] Multiple branches ensure it's easy to find example YAML files after forking.
- [x] **System**
  - [x] Supports Ubuntu 20.04-24.04.
  - [x] Supports Arch Linux.
